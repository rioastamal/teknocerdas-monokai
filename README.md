## TeknoCerdas Monokai

This is another alternative for iterm2 (and iterm) Monokai based theme. This one is based on Monokai Soda taken from [https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/).

Whats the Different from the Monokai Soda?

- Background color using RGB (40, 41, 35) similar which found in Sublime Text 3
- Selection text using Cyan color

The rest should be the same.
